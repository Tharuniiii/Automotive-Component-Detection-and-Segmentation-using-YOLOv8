# Automotive-Component-Detection-and-Segmentation-using-YOLOv8
This project focuses on automated detection and segmentation of car components using the YOLOv8 segmentation model. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision, the system can identify and outline key parts of a vehicle such as doors, headlights, bumpers, and windshields from images.
